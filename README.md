# Zabbix maintenance from frontend
Welcome to the Opensource ICT Solutions GitHub, where you'll find all kinds of usefull Zabbix resources. 

This script is a script written in Python to create Zabbix maintenance from the frontend as a Zabbix user. As a Zabbix user it is not possible to create maintenance in the frontend because maintenance is not available on this user level. This script makes it possible.

Besides making it possible to set maintenance for Zabbix users, this script will also enable you to create maintenance wherever you can find a host or host group name in the frontend. This will make for easy access to maintenance.

## How to use the script
